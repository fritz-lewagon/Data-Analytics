# New York Police Department

The idea of this notebook is to download and inspect the Stop, Question and Frisk Data released by the New York Police Department every year in New York. 

The stop-question-and-frisk program, or stop-and-frisk, in New York City, is a New York City Police Department practice of temporarily detaining, questioning, 
and at times searching civilians and suspects on the street for weapons and other contraband. 
This policy allowed police officers to stop, interrogate and search New York City citizens on the sole basis of “reasonable suspicion” for several years.
